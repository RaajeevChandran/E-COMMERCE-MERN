A MERN STACK E-COMMERCE PROJECT

(https://amazbay-37f78.firebaseapp.com)[Click here to see it in Live Action!]

###`OVERVIEW`
A Full-Stack e-commerce website which lets users create an account and buy products by adding it to their cart.The boilerplate for the admin dashboard is all done and all users who sign up absolutely end up being a normal user. I've incorporated Stripe as the payment gateway after the product further proceeds to be placed as an order (just clickbait stuff doesn't process a real payment though). Got myself familairized in playing with the browser cookies and JSON web tokens (jwt).

###`TECH STACK`
1. Front-End : React
2. Back-End : Node and Express (Hosted on Heroku)
3. Database : MongoDB (Hosted on MongoDB Atlas Cluster)
4. Website Hosting : Firebase

###`BACKLOGS DONE SO FAR`
1. Channelising users as Administrators and Normal Users.Different Dashboard Pages for the latter as well.
2. Administrator accounts are granted the privileges of all CRUD operations with the production database like adding a product or category, managing products, categories or orders etc.
3. Added teeny-tiny user interactions to the front-end.
4. Integrated the application with Stripe payment gateway.

###`TO-DO's`
1. Making the site entirely responsive.
2. Create more categories of products.
3. Enhance user engagement with vivid front-end magic.
